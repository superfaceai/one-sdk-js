OneSDK is a universal API client and core library of Superface. It provides a simple and uniform interface across many APIs and automatic runtime switching between API providers.

See [how Superface works](https://superface.ai/how-it-works) and [get started](https://superface.ai/docs/getting-started).

## Install

Install the project into Node.js project with npm:

```shell
npm install @superfaceai/one-sdk
```

or Yarn:

```shell
yarn add @superfaceai/one-sdk
```

## Usage

ðŸ’¡ **For quick usage example, check [get started](https://superface.ai/docs/getting-started) documentation.**

OneSDK works with [Superface CLI](https://github.com/superfaceai/cli). First you install a profile for the use-case you want to use by executing this command in the project directory:

```shell
npx @superfaceai/cli install <profileName>
```

Next you configure a provider for the use-case, optionally with API keys:

```shell
npx @superfaceai/cli configure <providerName> -p <profileName>
```

The CLI creates a configuration file in `superface/super.json` file which is loaded by OneSDK.

In your code, you initialize the SDK instance, load the profile and perform the use-case:

```js
const { SuperfaceClient } = require('@superfaceai/one-sdk');

const sdk = new SuperfaceClient();

async function run() {
  const profile = await sdk.getProfile('<profileName>');

  const result = await profile.getUseCase('<usecaseName').perform({
    // Input parameters
  });

  console.log(result.unwrap());
}

run();
```

Optionally you can [define which provider should be used](https://superface.ai/docs/guides/using-multiple-providers).

Check the [Superface Catalog](https://superface.ai/catalog) for existing use-cases or learn how to [write your own use-cases](https://superface.ai/docs/guides/how-to-create).

## Security

Superface doesn't act as a proxy and communicates with API providers directly; the secrets are sent only to the providers (see [how Superface works](https://superface.ai/how-it-works)).

OneSDK accesses `superface/super.json` file and accesses cache in `superface/.cache` directory. It also accesses local maps, profiles, and provider configuration if specified in the `super.json` file. Non-local maps, profiles and provider configuration are loaded from the Superface network registry in the runtime and cached locally. OneSDK sends diagnostic usage report to Superface as described [below](#metrics-reporting).

More about the journey of the secrets within OneSDK can be found in [Security](SECURITY.md).

## Metrics Reporting

OneSDK sends anonymized information about use-cases usage to Superface services. This info is anonymized, rate limited and allows you to [monitor your integrations](https://superface.ai/docs/integrations-monitoring) on the dashboard.

There are three kinds of metrics reported one is sent when the client instance is created, one after each perform (reporting success or failure), and one when a provider failover happens.

The reports can be disabled with environment variable:

```shell
SUPERFACE_DISABLE_METRIC_REPORTING=true
```

For metrics to be successfuly sent, the application needs to be properly exited, i.e. there should be no unhandled Promise rejections or exceptions.
