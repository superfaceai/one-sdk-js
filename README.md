OneSDK is a universal API client which provides an unparalleled developer experience for every HTTP API. It enhances resiliency to API changes, and comes with built-in integration monitoring and provider failover.

For more details about Superface, visit [How it Works](https://superface.ai/how-it-works) and [Get Started](https://superface.ai/docs/getting-started).

## Install

To install OneSDK into a Node.js project, run:

```shell
npm install @superfaceai/one-sdk
```

or Yarn:

```shell
yarn add @superfaceai/one-sdk
```

## Usage

OneSDK can be used in one of two ways:

* Without configuration: You pass the most essential configuration directly as a function parameter in code. Ideal for small projects and trying Superface out.

* With configuration: You configure Superface via a local configuration file (or a configuration object obtained elsewhere). Ideal for larger projects, or when you need advanced features, such as provider failover or locally-stored profiles, maps and providers.

ðŸ’¡ **For a quick usage example, check out [Get Started](https://superface.ai/docs/getting-started).**

### First time use

You need to provide:
* profile name and version
* use case name
* provider name
* input parameters
* (if necessary) provider-specific integration parameters
* (if necessary) provider-specific security values

These can be found in the [Catalog](https://superface.ai/catalog) and on the profile page (e.g. [vcs/user-repos](https://superface.ai/vcs/user-repos)). Security values need to be obtained through the relevant provider (e.g. on their website, in your account settings, etc.).

```js
const { SuperfaceClient } = require('@superfaceai/one-sdk');

const sdk = new SuperfaceClient();

async function run() {
  const profile = await sdk.getProfile({ id: '<profileName>', version: '<profileVersion>'});

  const result = await profile.getUseCase('<usecaseName>').perform({
    // TODO: more detail description?
    // Input parameters
  },
  {
    provider: '<providerName>',
    parameters: {
      // Provider specific integration parameters in format:
      '<integrationParameterId>': '<integrationParameterValue>'
    },
    security: {
      // Provider specific security values in format:
      '<securityValueId>': {
        // TODO: also have foobar here?
        // Security value
      }
    }
  });

  console.log(result.unwrap());
}

run();
```

### Advanced usage
<!-- TODO: probably leave the in code super.json as a last option as it is difficult to configure-->
<!-- TODO: mention getProviderForProfile? -->

There are some features that cannot be used with the simple approach described above, namely:
  - Using locally stored profiles, maps and providers; e.g. (yet) unpublished integrations, or integrations with APIs internal to your organization. 
  - Configuring [provider failover](https://superface.ai/docs/guides/using-multiple-providers#failover).

Also, as your project grows in size and complexity, you may find it useful to have a central location for configuring details concerning your API integrations.

`super.json` is the main Superface configuration file, located by default in the `superface` folder under your project root, but it can also be passed as a parameter in code, if for instance, your environment makes it inconvenient to use the filesystem.

To get started, first **install** a use case profile using the [Superface CLI](https://github.com/superfaceai/cli).

In the project directory, run:

```shell
npx @superfaceai/cli install <profileName>
```

The CLI creates a configuration file in `superface/super.json`.

Next, you configure a provider for the use case:

```shell
npx @superfaceai/cli configure <providerName> -p <profileName>
```

CLI may instruct you about setting up API keys if the provider needs them.

In your code, initialize the SDK instance, load the profile and perform the use case:

```js
const { SuperfaceClient } = require('@superfaceai/one-sdk');

const sdk = new SuperfaceClient();

async function run() {
  const profile = await sdk.getProfile('<profileName>');

  const result = await profile.getUseCase('<usecaseName>').perform({
    // Input parameters
  });

  console.log(result.unwrap());
}

run();
```

This code will use the first provider by priority as defined in `super.json` file. You can explicitly set the provider for `perform`:

```diff
 async function run() {
   const profile = await sdk.getProfile('<profileName>');

+  const provider = await sdk.getProvider('<providerName>');

   const result = await profile.getUseCase('<usecaseName>').perform(
     {
       // Input parameters
     },
+    { provider }
   );

   console.log(result.unwrap());
 }
```

To find available use cases, visit the [Catalog](https://superface.ai/catalog). If you are missing a use case, [let us know](#support)! You can also always [add your own use-case or API provider](https://superface.ai/docs/guides/how-to-create).

## Security

Superface is not a proxy. The calls are always going directly from your application to API providers. Their contents are **never** sent anywhere else but to the selected provider's API.

OneSDK accesses `superface/super.json` file if instructed to, and accesses cache in `superface/.cache` directory. It also accesses local maps, profiles, and provider configuration as per configuration. Non-local maps, profiles and providers are loaded from the Superface remote registry at runtime, and cached locally. OneSDK also sends diagnostic usage report to Superface as described [below](#metrics-reporting).

More about how OneSDK handles secrets can be found in [SECURITY](SECURITY.md).

## Metrics Reporting

Superface allows you to [monitor your integrations](https://superface.ai/docs/guides/integrations-monitoring) and display the metrics on a dashboard. There are three kinds of metrics reported:

1. When an OneSDK instance is created
2. After each perform (reporting success or failure of a given use case)
3. When a provider failover is triggered

This functionality requires you to obtain and set a `SUPERFACE_SDK_TOKEN`. For more information, see [Integrations Monitoring](https://superface.ai/docs/guides/integrations-monitoring).

OneSDK also sends anonymized metadata about its usage to Superface services. This data contains no personal information nor the contents of the API calls, is rate limited as to not impact performance, and can be disabled by setting an environment variable:

```shell
SUPERFACE_DISABLE_METRIC_REPORTING=true
```

For metrics to be successfuly sent, the application needs to exit properly, i.e. there should be no unhandled `Promise` rejections or exceptions.
